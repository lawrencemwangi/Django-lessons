    <h2>Benefits of Using CSS Preprocessors</h2>
    
    <div class="blog_content">
        <h3> Consistency and Flexibility with Variables</h3>
        <p>One of the most significant advantages of using a CSS preprocessor is the ability to define variables. Variables enable developers to store common values, 
            such as colors, fonts, or layout dimensions, in a single place. This makes it easy to maintain a consistent design across a website,
            as all styles that reference these variables will update automatically when the value changes. 
            Additionally, using variables reduces the chance of errors and simplifies global design changes.

        <h3>Reusability with Mixins</h3>
        <p>Mixins are another powerful feature of CSS preprocessors. They allow developers to define reusable blocks of code that can be 
            applied to multiple selectors. This is particularly useful for repetitive styling tasks, such as applying vendor 
            prefixes for browser compatibility or creating complex design patterns. With mixins, developers can write
            a piece of code once and reuse it across various parts of the site, reducing duplication and improving 
            maintainability.
